Note
================

This is an unmaintained fork of the wkhtmltopdf composer package, with a replaced binary (0.12.5). It served as a quick hotfix replacement for the problematic 0.12.4 binary.

It is not recommended to use this repository, instead you should use a composer script to install the latest binary package directly. For more information see:
